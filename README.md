# The Random Task Picker
This is an app designed to randomly pick tasks that you need to do from a list.

## How to use it
The general way to use this app is to add all the tasks you need to do in a project, day etc.
Then click on the generate button for the randomiser to pick a task you need to do from your list.

## Why?
Coming off the back of some sizeable university projects, I thought I might task some time to dabble and learn TypeScript at a smaller scale, and understand how it interacts with React.
